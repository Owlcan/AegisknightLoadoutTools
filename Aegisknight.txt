# **Aegisknight**

The Aegisknight is a warrior engineer who powers an ever-mutable suit of magical raiments—one moment a stalwart defender draped in the soft glow of innocent youth and feminine charm, a warrior of love and justice; the next, a crusader against injustice whose heart beats for excitement, speed, and the open road. Sometimes they emerge as a peerless champion in darkness—a silent bulwark against evil, a patient revanchist, a dark knight casting ominous shadows over foes. In truth, the Aegisknight is as multifaceted as a prism: a shapeshifter of ideals, a kinetic paradox, and a living testament that heroism defies definition. Whether they embody the tender radiance of compassion or the fierce intensity of relentless retribution, the Aegisknight continually reinvents what it means to be a hero in a world that refuses to be boxed in.

___
## **Core Class Mechanics**

### **Hit Points**
- **Hit Dice:** Your hit dice are based on your Chest Armor type:
  - **Balanced Type:** d10 per Aegisknight level.
  - **Bulwark Type:** d12 per Aegisknight level.
  - **Light Type:** d8 per Aegisknight level.
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** (Die value based on your chest piece) + your Constitution modifier.
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** Roll your designated hit die (or take the fixed alternative) + your Constitution modifier for each level after 1.

### **Proficiencies**
- **Armor:** Your magitek suit (all components combined—this is your armor).
- **Weapons:** Simple and martial weapons.
- **Tools:** You gain proficiency with one profession or artisan tool of your choice. (Some armor components may grant additional tool proficiencies.)
- **Saving Throws:** Strength and Wisdom.
- **Skills:** Choose three from Athletics, Acrobatics, Perception, Insight, Investigation, Intimidation, Persuasion, or Sleight of Hand.

### **Equipment**
You start with:
- (a) a longsword or (b) a warhammer.
- (a) a light crossbow with 20 bolts or (b) a simple firearm with 20 bullets (if firearms exist in your setting).
- An explorer’s pack or a dungeoneer’s pack.
- Your fully modular magitek armor (see below).

___
## **Cell Charges**

Your armor’s abilities are powered by **Cell Charges**. At 1st level, you have **5 Cell Charges**. You spend these charges to fuel many of the special abilities of your armor. You regain all expended charges after finishing a long rest and regain half your maximum charges after a short rest. Some components will increase your maximum or recharge rate as you level up.

___
## **Armor Activation**

At 1st level, you learn how to rapidly deploy your magitek suit:
- **Armor Activation (1st Level):** As an action, you can don or doff your armor a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus. When donned, your personal enhancements and modular abilities become active; when doffed, they are temporarily inactive (you still retain your proficiencies and saving throw benefits).

You may expend a single cell charge to don your armor as a bonus action, or when you have run out of allotted activations per long rest.
___
## **Power Surge (2nd Level)**

As a bonus action, you may spend **2 Cell Charges** to surge extra power through your armor for 1 minute. Choose one of the following effects until the end of your turn:
- Gain advantage on all attack rolls or saves (choose one).
- Deal 1d8 damage of your choice upon successful melee attack.
- Use the dash command as a bonus action.
- Gain resistance to all damage.

You may use this feature a number of times per long rest equal to your proficiency bonus or it may be activated as part of an armor's progression features.

Additionally, you may expend one cell charge to activate a power that is usable once per short rest to activate it again.

___
## **Level Progression**

The class gains features as you level up. The modular equipment (Helmet, Pauldrons, Gloves/Arms, Chest Armor, Legs/Boots, and Raiment) each has its own upgrade path. (For these options, “to start” refers to the baseline ability when you first choose that component.)

## **Modular Armor Components**

For each armor piece, choose one option when you create your character. ***Any new, complex, or otherwise obscure mechanics are explained below these features.***

### **1. Helmet Options**

**A. Hypersensory Scanner Array**  
*This advanced helmet is a marvel of sensory enchantment, merging arcane optics with practical battlefield awareness. Its glassy, rune-etched visor and faintly humming sensors grant you unparalleled insight into the unseen. Whether darkness or illusion conceals your foes, your vision—and your investigative prowess—remains unfaltering.*

- **To Start (Level 1):**  
  - **Darkvision Bestowal:** If you do not already have it, you gain darkvision out to 60 ft., allowing you to see in nocturnal or dimly lit environments.  
  - **Basic Sensor:** Your helmet is equipped with a rudimentary sensor that highlights hidden or invisible creatures, functioning similarly to a “detect invisibility” effect. This ability can be activated once per short rest.

- **Level 4 Upgrade:**  
  - **Enhanced Detection Mode:** As a bonus action, you can activate an improved sensor that reveals any invisible creatures within a 30-ft radius for 1 minute. This upgraded detection effect is usable once per short rest, ensuring that no subtle presence goes unnoticed.

- **Level 7 Upgrade:**  
  - **Truesight Activation:** Your perceptive faculties are augmented, granting you Truesight out to 30 ft. for 1 minute, once per short rest. With this ability, illusions, disguises, and obfuscations dissolve before your gaze.

- **Level 11 Upgrade:**  
  - **Investigative Augmentation:** When you activate your sensor using an action, you also gain advantage on Investigation checks to find illusions or any hidden entities, and you can discern the location of hidden doorways for 1 minute. 

- **Level 14 Upgrade:**  
  - **Augmented Sensory Overload:** Your helmet’s visionary might expands further: your Truesight range increases to 60 ft., and you can now, as an action, detect magical auras within a 30-ft radius. 

**B. Neuroprotective Casement**  
*The Neuroprotective Casement is a masterwork of mental fortification—a sleek, rune-etched helmet designed to shield your mind from intrusive psychic assaults. Swirling patterns of arcane energy trace its surface, forming a barrier that not only hones your focus but also defies the subtle manipulation of hostile magic. Whether you face bewildering enchantments or overwhelming psychic force, this helmet stands as a steadfast guardian of your inner resolve.*

- **Level 11 Upgrade:**  
  - **Absolute Charm Rejection & Enhanced Force Resistance:** Your mental defenses reach new heights. You become completely immune to charm effects, and the Casement’s energy field extends its protection to offer additional resistance to force damage, softening the impact of overwhelming kinetic strikes.

- **Level 14 Upgrade:**  
  - **Psychic Bastion:** The pinnacle of neuroprotective artistry is achieved. You gain full immunity to psychic damage, and your sharp intellect is further safeguarded by advantage on Intelligence saving throws—ensuring that your mind remains a bastion against all forms of mental coercion.

- **Level 11 Upgrade:**  
  - **Enhanced Barrier:** The protective enchantments surge further, granting an **extra +1 bonus to AC (total +2)**. Additionally, you choose one damage type of your choice to receive further protection—whether by gaining resistance or immunity, the helm adapts to your needs.

- **Level 14 Upgrade:**  
  - **Arcane Shielding:** At its zenith, the Ultimate-Bastion Heavy Helmet solidifies its defenses with unassailable magic.

 - **Level 11 Upgrade:**  
   - **Radiant Feedback:** When you activate any of the hood’s detection or scanning abilities, you can empower your next attack or spell to deal extra radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your proficiency modifier. If attuned with the Godhead Shard, this bonus increases to 2d8 radiant damage.

- **To Start (Level 1):**  
  - **Enhanced Resonant Momentum:** You gain a **+2 bonus to Athletics and Acrobatics checks** as the pauldron amplifies your physical prowess. Additionally, whenever you take the Dash action, you store 1 “Kinetic Charge” that can be used to enhance your next melee attack or reaction attack. Kinetic Charges reset at the start of your next turn if you do not move at least 10ft. The maximum number of Kinetic Charges you can store is equal to your Aegisknight level. 
  - At any time you are storing more than 1 charge in combat, you may choose to **Sudden Discharge** the energy- functioning like Hellish Rebuke, but exploding outward in a 15 foot radius centered on the user, DEX saves, spell level of the variant Hellish Rebuke is determined by number of charges above 2 that were expended.
 - If you end combat with more than 1 Kinetic Charge stored, you may immediately convert it into a restored Cell Charge at a rate of 2/3/4/5... per cell charge restored. 
:
- **Level 4 Upgrade:**  
  - **Momentum Augmentation:** When you move at least half your speed in a turn, you now gain **advantage on Dexterity saving throws** as your body rides the raw momentum. In addition, any Kinetic Charge you gain lingers until the start of your next turn, allowing you to preserve its energy for a more opportune moment.

- **Level 7 Upgrade:**  
  - **Explosive Impact:** When you expend a Kinetic Charge to enhance a melee attack, your strike now deals an extra **1d8 force damage** and optionally pushes the target 5 feet away from you. You can use this explosive bonus once per short rest.

- **Level 11 Upgrade:**  
  - **Chain Reaction Counter:** When you’re hit by a melee attack while holding at least one stored Kinetic Charge, you may use your reaction to unleash a burst of stored energy.

As its power grows, so too does its ability to bend space and unleash dazzling bursts of energy that shatter the darkness.*

- **To Start (Level 3):**  
  - **Causal Points:** You gain a small pool of “Causal Points” equal to your proficiency bonus. These points represent stored radiant energy that you can expend on abilities mimicking a luminancer’s powers—such as a low-level version of a Causal Missile (a ranged damage effect) or a Causal Shield (an energy barrier to protect you).

- **Level 3 Upgrade:**  
  - **Enhanced Energy Reservoir:** Your innate connection to the radiant forces deepens, increasing your Causal Point pool by 2. This upgrade reflects the Engine’s improved efficiency in harnessing cosmic light.

- **Level 6 Upgrade:**  
  - **Luminal Motion:** You acquire the ability to cast *Luminal Motion*, a dazzling 30‑ft teleport, once per short rest. By spending Cell Charges to activate this ability, you vanish in a burst of radiant light and reappear at a location you can see, blending mobility with brilliance.

- **Level 8 Upgrade:**  
  - **Hastened Radiance:** The Engine’s protective energies begin to fortify your very being. You gain resistance to both radiant and necrotic damage, as the interplay of light and shadow shields you from opposing forces.

- **Level 12 Upgrade:**  
  - **Nova Eruption:** At the pinnacle of its power, the Luminant Engine transforms into an awe-inspiring force. You gain immunity to radiant damage, and once per long rest, you can expend a large burst of Causal Points to unleash a miniature Causal Nova. This scaled-down 9th-level effect radiates from you in a blinding explosion, dealing significant radiant damage to all creatures in its area and temporarily banishing the encroaching darkness.

**F. Mystery Module**  
*Shrouded in enigma and ever unpredictable, the Mystery Module is the wild card of your raiment. Its true nature is determined by fate—a roll on a custom table (crafted by your DM) unleashes its myriad potential, whether that means bonus Cell Charges, a quirky spell-like ability, or even an extra proficiency. As its power is refined through upgrades, the module's chaotic gifts become a reliable part of your arsenal, setting you apart as an Aegisknight of limitless possibility.*

- **To Start (Level 3):**  
  - **Variable Effect:** Roll on a custom DM table to determine your module’s baseline effect. Options might include receiving bonus Cell Charges, acquiring a unique spell-like ability, or gaining an extra proficiency in a specific skill.
  
- **Level 3 Upgrade:**  
  - **Stable Augmentation:** The initial randomness is tempered by the module’s evolving design. You gain a stable bonus—such as temporary immunity to a specific damage type once per day or a constant +1 bonus to AC—that remains in effect until further upgrades alter its nature.
  
- **Level 6 Upgrade:**  
  - **Unlocked Potential:** The module reveals an additional ability determined by your DM’s table. This extra effect might manifest as a once-per-short-rest area effect, a sudden boost to your mobility, or another surprising benefit that adds depth to your combat versatility.
  
- **Level 8 Upgrade:**  
  - **Reality Shifter:** A rechargeable special action is integrated into the module, allowing you to “bend reality” in a small but meaningful way. For instance, you might force all nearby enemies to reroll their attack rolls once per activation, introducing a tactical twist to critical moments.
  
- **Level 12 Upgrade:**  
  - **Module Ascendance:** The Mystery Module reaches its apotheosis—granting you a major ability (as determined by DM design) that unmistakably distinguishes your Aegisknight. This crowning effect might redefine your battlefield role, embodying the full, unpredictable power of chaos harnessed and mastered.

  **G. Transmorphic Belt: The Shapeshifter's Cinch**  

- **To Start (Level 3):**  
  - **Elemental Resistance:** Upon acquiring the Transmorphic Belt, choose one elemental damage type (fire, cold, lightning, acid, or poison). You gain resistance to that damage type.
  - **Breath of Transformation:** You learn to unleash a potent breath weapon as an action a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus. When activated, you emit a 30‑ft cone of elemental energy. Choose one of the following breath weapons at creation. You can change this breath weapon once per month, and whenever you can swap armor pieces.
***See Breath Weapon Chart for Details***
 ::    
  - **Shapeshift Initiation:** As an inherent bonus action, you can activate the belt’s growth mode. For a duration equal to **10 rounds + your Wisdom modifier** (minimum 1 round), your armor expands—granting you the Large Build trait. If you already possess Large Build (or have it granted by your Xtra-Hev Frame Chestpiece), you instead become Huge for the duration.

- **Level 6 Upgrade:**  
  - **Enhanced Breath:** Your breath weapon damage increases by 1d10 for Radiant, Necrotic, or Force variants (or by 1d4 for Poison, raising it from 4d4 to 5d4).
  - **Extended Transformation:** The duration of your size transformation increases by an additional 5 rounds.

- **Level 10 Upgrade:**  
  - **Elemental Mastery:** You may now select a second elemental variant for your breath weapon (allowing you to choose, for example, either Radiant or Necrotic on a given use) to add versatility.
  - **Augmented Resistance:** The resistance granted by your elemental choice improves—damage of that type is halved rather than simply resisted.

- **Level 14 Upgrade:**  
  - **Advanced Transformation:** Once per short rest, through a bonus action you can trigger a burst transformation. For the next 10 rounds + your Wisdom modifier, in addition to gaining the Large (or Huge) Build trait, your speed and Strength score increase by 2 (temporary bonuses).

| **Poison**     | Deals **4d4 poison damage**.<br>On a failed Constitution saving throw, targets are poisoned for 1 round and take an extra **1d4 poison damage** at the start of their next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Time**       | Deals **2d10 temporal damage**.<br>On a failed Constitution saving throw, targets experience temporal disruption – their movement is reduced to 0 and they suffer disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of their next turn.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Fire**       | Deals **2d10 fire damage**.<br>On a failed Constitution saving throw, targets become ignited – suffering an extra **1d6 fire damage** at the start of their next turn, and flammable objects in the area may catch fire.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Ice**        | Deals **2d10 cold damage**.<br>On a failed Constitution saving throw, targets become encased in a thin layer of frost, reducing their movement speed by 50% until the end of their next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Sonic**      | Deals **2d10 thunder damage**.<br>On a failed Constitution saving throw, targets are disoriented – they become deafened and suffer disadvantage on their next attack roll or ability check as the resounding shock unsettles them.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Electricity**| Deals **2d10 lightning damage**.<br>On a failed Constitution saving throw, targets are stunned for 1 round as the surge of energy incapacitates them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

- **Capstone (Level 18 or 20):**  
  - **Monstrous Metamorphosis:** Once per long rest, as an action, you can transform into a huge-sized armored monster of your choice (CR 13 or lower). In this form, you adopt the creature’s stat block (per DM guidance) but retain your Aegisknight features and the ability to use your breath weapon. This transformation lasts for 1 minute.

- **Additional Notes:**  
  - The breath weapon’s damage scales with your level as noted above, reflecting your growing mastery over elemental manipulation.
  - Activating any manifestation of the Transmorphic Belt’s abilities requires spending the appropriate number of Cell Charges per standard Aegisknight mechanics.
  - The combination of elemental resistance, versatile breath attacks, and size-altering transformation makes the Transmorphic Belt a formidable tool for adapting to any encounter.
___  
  **H. Unstable Fury Core**  
*Deep within the heart of this raiment pulses a volatile engine of primal might. Drawing on the furious legacy of barbarian rage and refined via Aegisknight ingenuity, the Unstable Fury Core transforms raw aggression into pinpoint, destructive power. Each surge unleashes soul-crushing blows against a single foe—but beware: such overwhelming energy demands a heavy price. Every activation costs an extra cell charge and teeters on the brink of catastrophic overload, reminding you that even fury can turn on its master.*

- **To Start (Level 3):**  
  - **Fury Mode Activation:** As an action, once per short rest, you may activate Unstable Fury mode for 1 minute. While in this state, your melee attacks deal an additional **1d6 force damage** and each successful hit grants you temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. You may activate Fury Mode more than once if you expend **2 Charge Cells**  but there is an inherent risk of overloading the core when this is performed.
  - **Extra Charge Cost:** All abilities granted by the Fury Core cost an additional 1 cell charge per use.  
  - **Overload Risk:** At the end of each turn while in Fury mode, roll a d20. On a roll of 1–3, the core overloads—ending Fury mode immediately and forcing you to absorb 1d8 force damage as chaotic backlash.

- **Level 3 Upgrade:**  
  - **Deepening the Rage:** Your Unstable Fury mode now lasts for **2 minutes**. The bonus damage on melee attacks increases to **1d8 force damage**. Furthermore, when Fury mode ends normally, you recover an additional cell charge as you reclaim a measure of the spent raw power.

- **Level 6 Upgrade:**  
  - **Focused Smash:** While in Fury mode, once per short rest you can channel your rage into a devastating focused strike. Activate this ability to have your next melee attack against a single target deal an extra **2d10 force damage** that bypasses any resistances. Using this focused strike costs an additional **1 cell charge**. If the attack misses, your next overload check suffers a heightened risk: a d20 roll of 1 now triggers misfire, inflicting **2d8 force damage** upon you.

- **Level 8 Upgrade:**  
  - **Field Stabilizer:** Your control over the wild energy improves. While in Fury mode, you gain **temporary resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage**. Additionally, the Overload check becomes slightly more forgiving—now only a roll of 1–2 (instead of 1–3) results in a misfire. The extra charge cost remains in effect, a constant reminder of the peril in channeling such furious power.

- **Level 12 Upgrade:**  
  - **Fury Unleashed:** Once per long rest, you can harness the full, unbridled might of the Unstable Fury Core. As an action, expend an extra **3 cell charges** to execute Fury Unleashed—a cataclysmic single-target attack that deals **4d10 force damage**. The target must also make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier); on a failure, it is stunned until the end of your next turn.  
    - **Severe Overload Risk:** While using Fury Unleashed, immediately perform an overload check. If you roll a 1 on a d20, the chaotic energies erupt back against you, inflicting **4d10 force damage**.  
    - After using Fury Unleashed, you cannot activate Unstable Fury mode again until you complete a long rest, as your core requires deep recalibration from the massive energy discharge.

###### Singularity Drive
*A **Singularity Drive** is an experimental gravitational core that grants control over spatial distortions. It enhances movement and battlefield manipulation by allowing momentary teleportation, repulsion fields, and time-dilation effects.*

- **To Start (Level 3):**  
Your Singularity Drive grants instinctive repositioning and subtle spatial control.
  - **Event Blink:** By expending **3 charge cells**, you can instantly **teleport 15 feet** as a **reaction when attacked**. *This movement negates the triggering attack if it relies on physical contact.* You may use this ability as a reaction to defend allies within 5ft as well as yourself.
  - **Dimensional Distortion:** You generate a minor gravitational field, forcing enemies within 5 feet to have disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you and allies within 5ft of you.
:
- **Level 6 Upgrade:**  
Expanding your control over localized gravity, you gain access to repulsion-based battlefield manipulation.
  - **Spatial Pulse:** By spending 3 Cell Charges, you unleash a gravitational shockwave. All creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a Strength save (DC = 8 + proficiency + Wisdom modifier) or be pushed 10 feet away.
  - **Singularity Step:** You gain an additional Event Blink charge, which can now be used once per turn.
:
- **Level 8 Upgrade:**  
Your gravitational mastery deepens, allowing momentary singularities to reshape the battlefield.
  - **Event Horizon:** By spending 6 Cell Charges, you create a localized gravitational singularity (10-ft radius) for 1 round. Hostile creatures in the area must succeed on a Strength save or be restrained until the end of your next turn.
  - **Kinetic Instability:** Your Singularity Step now allows you to teleport 20 feet instead of 15.
:
- **Level 12 Upgrade:**  
  Your ability to warp physical energy reaches its peak, allowing you to disperse force and manipulate the flow of battle.
  - **Entropy Shield:** When struck by an attack, you may spend 4 Cell Charges to temporarily disperse kinetic force. This halves incoming physical damage for 1 minute.
  - **Singular Flow:** You gain resistance to force damage, and any forced movement imposed upon you by an enemy is reduced by half.
  
  **Incense Censer Pauldron**  
*For the cautious tactician and support fighter, this pauldron resembles an incense censer that dispenses beneficial vapors to aid allies and subtly hinder foes.*

- **To Start (Level 1):**  
  - **Basic Dispersion:** When activated (by expending 1–2 Cell Charges), choose one incense from the table below. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus.

- **Level 4 Upgrade:**  
  - **Enhanced Diffusion:** All incense effects have their area increased by 10 ft. and their duration extended by 1 round.

- **Level 7 Upgrade:**  
  - **Dual Incense Operation:** Once per short rest, you may release two distinct incense effects simultaneously. Both effects must be chosen from the table and must not aid enemies in the vicinity.

- **Level 11 Upgrade:**  
  - **Extended Coverage:** The effective radius of all incense effects increases by an additional 10 ft., and any aura effects grant allies within the area a +1 bonus on saving throws.

- **Level 14 Upgrade:**  
  - **Sacramental Concoction:** You may expend an extra 3 Cell Charges (in addition to the base cost) to combine two incense effects for a new effect. For example, merging Healing Ember with Sacred Zephyr creates a “Healing Zephyr” that restores hit points and grants an extra 10 ft. of movement speed for one round.

| **Sacred Zephyr**   | Allies within 10 ft. gain an additional 5 ft. of movement speed until the effect ends.                                           |
| **Mystic Veil**     | Creates a 20‑ft sphere of magical vapor that only those with magical sight can penetrate; allies inside gain advantage on Stealth checks, while enemies suffer disadvantage on Perception checks. |

## Armor Features Explained

### Hyperscanner's Secondary Starting Ability
**Hypersensory Scanner Array**  
This secondary feature – built into the Hyperscanner option for the Helmet – grants advanced visual detection. At its base, it provides darkvision (up to 60 ft.) if you lack it and lets you, once per short rest, briefly highlight hidden or invisible creatures. By activating its sensor mode, the helmet temporarily overlays your vision with a subtle glow that reveals otherwise imperceptible silhouettes, ensuring you never miss stealthy foes or hidden traps.

### Tech-Pauldron Benefits to Magic and Craft Preparation
**Tech Pauldron (Tech Type)**  
The tech-pauldron is engineered for versatility in both magical and technical tasks. It grants you proficiency with an extra tool and adds two extra “robotic arms” that, while unable to attack or cast spells, sharply reduce the time needed for mundane or intricate tasks (such as crafting, disarming traps, or repairing mechanisms). These arms grant a substantial +5 bonus to actions related to such preparatory or technical activities, making your overall routine more efficient.

### Starting Ability for Blastbreaker Fists
**Blastbreaker Fists**  
Designed for raw melee dominance, Blastbreaker Fists enhance your unarmed or melee combat. From the outset, they increase your base melee and unarmed damage. Their unique design allows you to wield two-handed weapons in one hand with no penalty, and they reclassify normally non-finesse light or one-handed weapons as finesse weapons for you. This versatility means you can combine speed and power in melee engagements while maintaining a high damage profile and flexibility in weapon choice.

### Somatic Satellites Synergy with Tech Pauldron
**Somatic Satellites**  
These small floating spheres serve two roles. On their own, they act as ranged missiles (delivering 1d8 force damage) or function as temporary spell storage devices. When paired with the Tech Pauldron, the satellites integrate with the robotic arms—bypassing the normal magic action economy. This synergy permits you to cast additional non-cantrip spells in one turn (provided a spell is stored in a satellite), effectively bolstering your overall casting capacity and allowing for powerful, unexpected bursts of magical might during combat.

### Starting AC Values and Abilities for Chest Armor Types
**Chest Armor Options**  
- **Balanced Type:**  
  - *Starting AC:* 14 + DEX (max2)

- **Bulwark Type:**  
  - *Starting AC:* 16 
  - *Starting Ability:* Once per day, negate one chosen magical or physical damage type for 1 minute.
- **Light Type:**  
  - *Starting AC:* 13 + DEX  
  - *Starting Ability:* Provides a static increase to movement speed (e.g., +15 ft.) and a temporary +1 shield bonus to AC while active.

### Blastcore Soles Mechanics
**Blastcore Soles**  
These advanced boots are engineered for volatile, high-speed movement. At the start, they set your base movement speed at 40 ft. and grant advantage on jump checks provided you have a 10-ft running start. Once per short rest, they allow the user to attempt a leap over enemies without provoking opportunity attacks—using an Acrobatics check with a DC that scales by enemy size. Upgrades later enhance jump distance, reduce mishap risks, and eventually confer immunity to fall damage while creating a damaging shockwave upon landing.

### Soul Core Manifold Charge Boost Mechanics
**Soul Core Manifold**  
The Soul Core Manifold is integral to the suit’s energy management. In its starting mode, it grants you two bonus Cell Charges over other raiments and improves your recharge rate (restoring an extra half-hit-die’s worth of charges per short rest). As upgrades are applied, the manifold further accelerates charge recovery, ensuring that your suit’s active abilities remain consistently fueled during prolonged engagements.

### **Mechanics Tip: Cell Charge Activation for Aegisknight Abilities**

Any Aegisknight ability that can be used once per short rest is activated by expending **1 Cell Charge**. If an ability has a base cost higher than 1, you must expend that many Cell Charges each time you use it.

Any Aegisknight ability that can be used once per long rest can be activated more than the allotted amount of times by expending **3 Cell Charges** per further activation. If these skills incur any risk of overload or critical failure, that risk is heightened by forcing the armor to process the strain of converting energy into the specific power. That risk of failure should be represented as a roll of 1-2 on a d20.

*Note:* Certain armor pieces – such as the **Unstable Fury Core** – are designed to channel especially overwhelming power and inherently require extra Cell Charges for every activation of their abilities. Be sure to review each item's individual activation cost and manage your Cell Charge pool wisely during your adventures!

### Godhead Shard Prayer/Rite Recharge Mechanics
**Godhead Shard**  
This divine component, mounted atop the Soul Core, operates on a ritualistic recharge method. At the base level, it restores 2 Cell Charges per short rest—but only if you pass a DC 14 Religion check, representing a brief prayer or rite. You have up to three attempts per recharge cycle, and failure limits its restorative capacity. In addition, invoking the shard requires a material component (oils, incenses, candles, or vapor cartridges costing 5 gp per fuel cell) if you wish to improvise additional recharges. This mechanic emphasizes the spiritual discipline needed to harness divine energies.

### Mystery Module Effect Chart
**Mystery Module (Initial Effects)**  
Whenever you activate a power, power surge, or expend a cell charge- or at the request of the DM- you may choose to roll on the Wonder Module Miracore table.

### Mystery Module 6th Level Upgrade Chart
**Mystery Module (6th Level Upgrades)**  
At 6th level, the Mystery Module improves via another the Wonder Node upgrade chart provided by your DM. This chart is provided on the next page. At the start of each day and during a short rest, you may roll on the Mystery Module table to determine your Wonder Node Upgrade for the day. This power can be triggered to activate whenever you use a power surge. By expending an additional **1 Cell Charge**, you can apply a random effect from the provided chart. By expending **3 Cell Charges**, you may choose the power upgrade you

### Mystery Module Level 8 Mechanic Description
**Mystery Module (8th Level Upgrade)**  
Upon reaching 8th level, the Mystery Module gains a powerful, rechargeable special action. This ability might force all enemies within a 10-ft radius to reroll their attack rolls or saving throws, or create a short-lived field of chaotic energy that disrupts enemy positioning. The effect activates once per short rest and lasts until the end of your next turn, reflecting the module’s maturing integration with your suit’s overall tactics.

### Mystery Module Level 12 Description
**Mystery Module (12th Level Upgrade)**  
At 12th level, the Mystery Module reaches its apex. It unlocks a major ability chosen from a DM-provided list—such as a potent area-of-effect attack, a robust defensive shield that triggers automatically in response to incoming damage, or even a temporary alteration to movement dynamics (like slowing foes or quickening allies). This ultimate upgrade distinguishes your Aegisknight by providing a game-changing feature that epitomizes the unique and unpredictable power of your customized armor.

Whenever you use your Power Surge ability, roll a d30 (or choose an effect at random) to determine an additional benefit or complication provided by your Mystery Module:

## Diaper-School Options for the Aegisknight

These playful, irreverent components are designed for Aegisknights who favor a whimsical, diaper‐themed aesthetic. They provide unique abilities and upgrades that not only fit the humorous theme but also offer tactical, flavor-rich utility for caster‐builds and socially oriented characters—or even those who prefer a less “hands‐on” approach.

___
### Pacifier-Themed Helmet: The Pacifier of Quietude
*For caster-builds who value quiet spellcasting and mental focus over brute protection.*

**To Start:**  
• **Silent Spellcasting:** Your pacifier helmet negates the need for verbal components when you cast spells, letting you channel your magic in an almost wordless, meditative state.  
• **Telepathic Link:** You gain short-range telepathy (up to 30 ft.) to communicate silently with allies.

**Level-Up Effects:**  
- **Level 4 Upgrade:** Your helmet mutes ambient noise around you, granting advantage on Concentration checks when casting spells in a loud environment.  
- **Level 7 Upgrade:** Enhance your telepathy to extend communication range to 60 ft. and allow nonverbal spell components to be entirely dispensed with.  
- **Level 11 Upgrade:** Gain a subtle “mind shield” that occasionally deflects disruptive mental effects (once per short rest, you can re-roll a failed Wisdom saving throw against a psychic effect).  
- **Level 14 Upgrade:** Your silent casting becomes nearly undetectable—opponents must succeed on a DC 15 Perception check to notice you casting spells, even if you use somatic components.

___

### Bonnet-Themed Helmet: The Bonnet of Blushing Bravado
*For those who’d rather charm than conceal, this ostentatiously babyish bonnet radiates an irresistible level of adorable absurdity that distracts everyone around it.*

**To Start (Level 1):**  
• **Innocent Charm:** The bonnet bestows a +1 bonus to Charisma and grants advantage on Persuasion checks, reflecting the pure, sugary innocence of its design.  
• **Captivating Cuteness:** Once per short rest, as an action, you may activate the bonnet’s captivating display. When activated, every creature (both allies and foes) within 10 ft. must immediately roll a "potty check"—a Constitution saving throw (DC = your class save DC, typically 14). On a failure, the creature is overwhelmed by the sheer babyish allure and becomes distracted: they lose their reaction and have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks involving concentration until the start of your next turn.

**Level-Up Effects:**  
- **Level 4 Upgrade:** The bonnet’s charm intensifies—your bonus to Charisma increases by an additional +1, and the effective radius of your captivating display increases to 15 ft. In addition, any creature that fails the potty check becomes dazed for 1 round instead of merely losing their reaction.  
- **Level 7 Upgrade:** Your bonnet now exudes an aura of irresistible whimsy that enhances your social prowess: you gain advantage on Deception and Performance checks related to your captivating presence.  
- **Level 11 Upgrade:** The bonnet further empowers you and your nearby allies. Allies within 10 ft. gain an additional +1 bonus to saving throws against fear, charm, and effects that would "soil" their spirits, as your infectious babyish delight bolsters their resolve.  
- **Level 14 Upgrade:** The pinnacle of infantile charm is reached. Once per long rest, you may invoke a "Potty Parade" as an action. When activated, every creature within 15 ft. must make a potty check (DC = 16, or your class save DC if higher). On a failure, the affected creatures become incapacitated by uncontrollable mirth and adoration for 1 round, as if caught in a state of utter, adorable distraction.
___

### Mitten-Themed Gauntlets: The Infantile Mittens
*These gauntlets feature oversized, cuddly mittens that limit fine dexterity but grant unique protective benefits.*

**To Start:**  
• **Inelegant Grip:** Your gauntlets impose a slight penalty on Dexterity-based tasks (at DM’s discretion) but make your hands less susceptible to traps and poisons—granting immunity to effects that rely solely on manual touch (such as handling a poisoned item or disarming trap triggers that require delicate manipulation).  
• **Anti-Curse Touch:** You have advantage on saving throws against curses or magical effects that require you to physically touch the triggering object.

**Level-Up Effects:**  
- **Level 4 Upgrade:** Although your manual finesse remains infantile, your gauntlets bolster your brute force—increasing your unarmed strike damage by 1d4.  
- **Level 7 Upgrade:** The mittens magically adjust to improve your grip in grappling, granting you advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks involving grappling or shoving.  
- **Level 11 Upgrade:** Gain an additional bonus to Strength checks that involve physical tasks (such as moving heavy objects) while wearing the gauntlets.
\page
- **Level 14 Upgrade:** Your gauntlets reach peak infantile power, giving a one-time bonus to any Strength-based contest per short rest—allowing you to automatically win a contest that involves raw physical touch.
___
### Bib-Themed Chest Armor Option: The Soiling Shield Bib
*This oversized, magically enchanted bib is designed to ward off the filth and chaos of the battlefield—ensuring that no matter how messy the combat gets, you (and your reputation) remain pristine.*

**To Start (Level 1):**  
• **Potty Protection:** You gain advantage on any ability checks or saving throws against effects that would “soil” you (whether from enemy abilities or environmental hazards), reflecting an innate resistance to the grimy influences that might otherwise tarnish you.  
• **Initial AC:** Your base AC is determined as 14 + your Dexterity modifier (up to a maximum bonus of +3), representing the bib’s modest physical protection.

**Level-Up Effects:**  
- **Level 4 Upgrade:** The bib’s enchantments improve—once per short rest, you can automatically succeed on a “potty check” (a saving throw against conditions that would impose a soiling or muck-related debuff).  
- **Level 7 Upgrade:** As the bib becomes more robust, it grants an additional +1 bonus to AC against “mucky” effects and provides resistance to one damage type related to filth (such as acid or sludge), channeling the protective functions seen in an *Absorbent Barrier*.  
- **Level 11 Upgrade:** The bib now exudes restorative magic; whenever an effect would soil or debilitate you, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Aegisknight level and reduce the duration of that effect by 1 round.  
- **Level 14 Upgrade:** The ultimate enchantment of the bib awakens: once per long rest, you can invoke the "Cleanliness Covenant" as an action. For 1 minute, you and all allies within 15 ft. become immune to soiling effects and automatically dispel any active conditions tied to filth.

___
___
### Playtime Engine: The Diaper Daycare Raiment
*Harnessing the wholesome chaos of Diaper School, this raiment transforms your suit’s central core into a beacon of nurturing mischief and disruptive battleflow.*

**Base Functionality (Level 3):**  
Drawing inspiration from the playful miracles and protective charms found in the Combat Academy Regulation Handbook, the Diaper Daycare Raiment grants you an array of diaper school–themed abilities:

• **Soothing Miracle:**  
  Once per short rest, invoke an aura reminiscent of the “Little Miracle” cantrip. For 1 minute, all allies within 15 ft. gain advantage on saving throws against fear and panic effects—bathed in a gentle, comforting radiance that soothes their wounds and worries. You may also create one other effect from the Little Miracle effect list that remains constant for the duration.

• **Absorbent Shield:**  
  When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to manifest an invisible, absorbent barrier (in the style of the “Absorbent Barrier” spell). This shield reduces the triggering damage by 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier as if your raiment momentarily mops up the impact.

• **Diaper Douse Blast:**  
  Once per short rest, you can unleash a burst of saturated, messy energy. As an action, all creatures within a 15-ft radius must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC = your class save DC) or have their movement reduced to 0 until the end of their next turn—as if suddenly caught in a drenching Diaper Douse.

**Level-Up Effects:**  

- **Level 4 Upgrade:**  
  The raiment’s soothing aura grows more potent. You may use Soothing Miracle one extra time per short rest.

- **Level 7 Upgrade:**  
  The disruptive field of Diaper Douse expands by an additional 5 ft., and its saving throw DC increases by 1. Additionally, Absorbent Shield now reduces damage by 1d10 instead of 1d8.

- **Level 11 Upgrade:**  
  You gain an enhanced protective synergy: once per short rest, you can combine Soothing Miracle and Absorbent Shield. When activated in tandem, you gain temporary hit points equal to your level while also reducing the next incoming attack’s damage by an extra 1d8.

- **Level 14 Upgrade:**  
  Unlock the ultimate “Diaper Time-Out” ability. Once per long rest, as an action, you force all enemies within 15 ft. to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 16 or your class save DC, whichever is higher). On a failure, affected creatures become incapacitated—overwhelmed by the absurdity and cuteness of your raiment—for 1 round.

This Diaper Daycare Raiment weaves humor with heartfelt magic, ensuring that amidst chaos on the battlefield, your nurturing influence both disrupts foes and uplifts your allies.

### Mephidium Coda: The Skunk’s Tail Raiment
*Embodying toxic misfortune and grimy power, the Mephidium Coda transforms your battle presence into a malodorous curse. When soiled by combat’s grime, its venomous energies intensify—buffing your poison attacks and, with devilish regularity, cursing friend and foe alike with untimely accidents.*

**To Start (Level 3):**  
• **Toxic Emission:** As an action, you can activate the Mephidium Coda to exude a noxious cloud in a 10‑ft radius. Every creature in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC = your class save DC) or take 1d6 poison damage and become “soiled”—their next attack roll is made at disadvantage until the start of your next turn. *If you are wearing a messy diaper, the DC increases by +2.*  
• **Soiled Buff:** When the Coda is in its “soiled” state (triggered whenever you load your diaper or when environmental grime or battle conditions “dirty” the raiment), you gain a +1 bonus to poison attack rolls and all of your poison effects deal an additional 1d4 points of poison damage.  
• **Malodorous Fortitude:** You gain resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against poison-based effects. You gain advantage against poison and gas-based effects that might cause you to mess your diaper, but you may voluntarily fail such a secondary effect to take half-damage or otherwise negate a primary effect (such as negating the damage of a Magic Messle missile by dumping butt into one's hero huggies).

**Level-Up Effects:**  
- **Level 3 Immediate Upgrade:** Once per short rest, you may command the Coda to surge with extra rancor. This ability increases its poison damage by 1d4 for the next activation and temporarily boosts the saving throw DC of its Toxic Emission by 1 until the start of your next turn.  
- **Level 6 Upgrade:** The area of Toxic Emission expands to 15‑ft, and any creature that fails the saving throw becomes more susceptible: they take an additional 1d4 poison damage from subsequent poison effects you inflict until the start of your next turn.  
- **Level 8 Upgrade:** When your Mephidium Coda is soiled, your next attack within the following round deals an extra 1d8 poison damage. Additionally, any target hit must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC increased by 1) or be poisoned for 1 round.  
- **Level 12 Upgrade:** Unleash the ultimate “Accidental Misfortune.” Once per long rest, you may invoke this power as an action. All enemies—and any unfortunate allies within a 15‑ft radius—must immediately make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 16 or your class save DC, whichever is higher). On a failure, they are overwhelmed by a vile stench and become incapacitated with nausea (treated as the poisoned condition) for 1 round while taking 2d8 poison damage. Until the start of your next long rest, any activation of Toxic Emission further increases your bonus to poison-based effect rolls by +2, and your resistance to poison damage is doubled.

**Flavor Text:**  
The Mephidium Coda is notorious among Aegisknights—both a badge of unholy misfortune and a weapon of repulsive efficacy. Like the lingering trail of a skunk, its power multiplies with every patch of filth clinging to its surface. When battle ends, its noxious aroma remains as a reminder: here, even the stench of decay has been harnessed to do your bidding.

**Diaper Duty Pauldrons**  
*Adorned with adorable embroidered swaddles, cartoonish bibs, and a scattering of tiny pacifiers, these pauldrons capture the nurturing chaos of diaper school. Infused with cleaning magic and childlike exuberance, they protect you with a refreshing burst of cleanliness—and a few surprises that will leave enemies (and allies) grinning in spite of themselves.*

- **To Start (Level 1):**  
  - **Absorbent Barrier:** When you are hit by a melee or ranged attack, you can use your reaction to activate an absorbent aura. Doing so reduces the damage taken by 1d6 + your proficiency bonus, as if a fresh, padded diaper cushions the blow. (Usable once per short rest.)  
  - **Cleanliness Aura:** Your ever-present freshness grants you a +1 bonus to saving throws against conditions linked to messy or soiled effects (such as slippery, muddy, or chaotic battlefield states).

- **Level 4 Upgrade:**  
  - **Sanitizing Swirl:** Once per short rest, you can use a bonus action to unleash a burst of cleansing energy in a 10‑ft radius around you. Every hostile creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or suffer disadvantage on their attack rolls until the start of your next turn, as they are briefly overwhelmed by an aroma of baby powder and scented wipes.

- **Level 7 Upgrade:**  
  - **Diaper Dash:** Channeling the quick-change efficiency of diaper school, you can, once per short rest as a bonus action, immediately stand up (if prone) and move an extra 10 ft. without provoking opportunity attacks. This nimble burst of movement embodies that swift diaper change when every second counts.

- **Level 11 Upgrade:**  
  - **Clean Sweep Counter:** Whenever you successfully use your Absorbent Barrier reaction, you can simultaneously splash a wave of cleansing liquid at your attacker. The attacker must then make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or have its movement reduced by half until the end of its next turn, as if caught in a slick torrent of freshly laundered magic.

- **Level 14 Upgrade:**  
  - **Ultimate Diaper Time-Out:** Once per long rest, as an action, you can invoke an aura of absolute cleanliness. For 1 minute, all hostile creatures within 15 ft. must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier) or become incapacitated with the ridiculous charm and overwhelming freshness. It’s as if your enemies have been put into an enforced “time-out” by the adorable authority of your impeccably clean appearance.
