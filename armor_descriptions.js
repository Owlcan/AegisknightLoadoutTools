Drawing on the furious legacy of barbarian rage and refined via Aegisknight ingenuity, the Unstable Fury Core transforms raw aggression into pinpoint, destructive power. Each surge unleashes soul-crushing blows against a single foe—but beware: such overwhelming energy demands a heavy price. Every activation costs an extra cell charge and teeters on the brink of catastrophic overload, reminding you that even fury can turn on its master.",

Activating Fury Mode costs <strong>1 Cell Charge</strong> (this is in addition to the Extra Charge Cost below, for a total of <strong>2 CC</strong> to activate). You may activate Fury Mode more times per short rest by expending an additional <strong>2 Cell Charges</strong> each time, but the Overload Risk increases (see below).\n<strong>Extra Charge Cost:</strong> All abilities granted <em>by the Fury Core itself</em> (not other armor components) cost an additional <strong>1 Cell Charge</strong> per use on top of their normal cost.\n<strong>Overload Risk:</strong> At the end of each turn while in Fury mode, roll a <strong>d20</strong>. On a roll of <strong>1–3</strong>, the core overloads—ending Fury mode immediately and forcing you to absorb <strong>1d8 force damage</strong> as chaotic backlash.

This shield reduces the triggering damage by <strong>1d8 + your spellcasting modifier</strong> as if your raiment momentarily mops up the impact. You can use this reaction once per encounter without spending Cell Charges. Additional uses before a short rest require expending <strong>1 Cell Charge</strong> per activation.\n\n<strong>Diaper Douse Blast:</strong> Once per short rest, you can unleash a burst of saturated, messy energy. As an <strong>action</strong>, all creatures within a <strong>15-ft. radius</strong> must succeed on a <strong>Dexterity saving throw</strong> (DC = your class save DC) or have their <strong>movement reduced to 0</strong> until the end of their next turn—as if suddenly caught in a drenching Diaper Douse. You may use this feature additional times by expending <strong>3 Cell Charges</strong> per use.",
       	 "3-upgrade": "Once per short rest, you may infuse the Diaper Douse Blast with greater power, damaging those doused in its muck. This ability adds <strong>damage of your Diaper Douse by 1d4</strong> for the next activation and temporarily <strong>boosts the saving throw DC</strong> of its Diaper Douse Blast by <strong>1</strong> until the start of your next turn.",
        	 "4": "<strong>More Soothing More Miracles:</strong> The raiment's soothing aura grows more potent. You may use Soothing Miracle <strong>one extra time per short rest</strong>. Additionally, the Cell Charge cost for additional activations beyond your free uses is reduced to <strong>1 Cell Charge</strong>.",
        	 "7": "<strong>Diaper Douser Shower:</strong> The disruptive field of Diaper Douse expands by an additional <strong>5 ft.</strong> (for a <strong>20-ft. total radius</strong>), and its saving throw DC <strong>increases by 1</strong>. Additionally, Absorbent Shield now reduces damage by <strong>1d10</strong> instead of 1d8. When you expend Cell Charges for additional activations of these abilities, you may choose to spend <strong>1 additional Cell Charge</strong> to increase the area of effect by another 5 ft. or to add your spellcasting ability modifier to the damage reduction.",

When activated in tandem, you gain <strong>temporary hit points equal to your level</strong> while also reducing the next incoming attack's damage by an <strong>extra 1d8</strong>. You can use this combined effect additional times by expending <strong>4 Cell Charges</strong>. For <strong>6 Cell Charges</strong>, you can extend the effect to also protect one ally within 15 feet, granting them the same benefits.",

On a failure, affected creatures become <strong>incapacitated</strong>—overwhelmed by the absurdity and cuteness of your raiment—for <strong>1 round</strong>. You can use this feature a second time before a long rest by expending <strong>5 Cell Charges</strong>, though doing so strains the raiment's systems, reducing your movement speed by 10 ft. until you complete a short or long rest due to the temporary overload.",
			"17": "<strong>Daycare Disruption (Capstone):</strong> Once per long rest, as an action, you can expend <strong>5 Cell Charges</strong> to create a zone of chaotic, nurturing energy. Choose a point you can see within 60 feet. A 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point becomes a disruptive daycare zone for 1 minute. Hostile creatures who start their turn in the area or enter it for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = <strong>8</strong> + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier) or be compelled to use their action to either move their full speed in a random direction or make a single weapon attack against a random creature within range (determined by a d6: 1-3 move, 4-6 attack). Allies in the area have advantage on saving throws against hostile effects. This ability cannot be used again until you finish a long rest."

You gain advantage against poison and gas-based effects that might cause you to mess your diaper, but you may voluntarily fail such a secondary effect to take half-damage or otherwise negate a primary effect (such as negating the damage of a Magic Messle missile by dumping butt into one's hero huggies).",

On a failure, they are overwhelmed by a vile stench and become incapacitated with nausea (treated as the poisoned condition) for 1 round while taking 2d8 poison damage.
