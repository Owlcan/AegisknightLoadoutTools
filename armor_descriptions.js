Additionally, you may also choose to use the Help action when an ally is Dodging, resisting a grapple, or attempting to deflect missiles—granting them an additional bonus to these attempts.\n**Rallying Word:** You learn the Guidance cantrip.

       fullDescription: "Deep within the heart of this raiment pulses a volatile engine of primal might. Drawing on the furious legacy of barbarian rage and refined via Aegisknight ingenuity, the Unstable Fury Core transforms raw aggression into pinpoint, destructive power. Each surge unleashes soul-crushing blows against a single foe—but beware: such overwhelming energy demands a heavy price. Every activation costs an extra cell charge and teeters on the brink of catastrophic overload, reminding you that even fury can turn on its master.",
       levelFeatures: {
           "3": "**Fury Mode Activation:** As an action, once per short rest, you may activate Unstable Fury mode for 1 minute. While in this state, your melee attacks deal an additional **1d6 force damage** and each successful hit grants you temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. You may activate Fury Mode more than once if you expend **2 Charge Cells** but there is an inherent risk of overloading the core when this is performed.\n**Extra Charge Cost:** All abilities granted by the Fury Core cost an additional 1 cell charge per use.\n**Overload Risk:** At the end of each turn while in Fury mode, roll a d20. On a roll of 1–3, the core overloads—ending Fury mode immediately and forcing you to absorb 1d8 force damage as chaotic backlash.\n**Deepening the Rage:** Your Unstable Fury mode now lasts for **2 minutes**. The bonus damage on melee attacks increases to **1d8 force damage**. Furthermore, when Fury mode ends normally, you recover an additional cell charge as you reclaim a measure of the spent raw power.",

Activate this ability to have your next melee attack against a single target deal an extra **2d10 force damage** that bypasses any resistances. Using this focused strike costs an additional **1 cell charge**. If the attack misses, your next overload check suffers a heightened risk: a d20 roll of 1 now triggers misfire, inflicting **2d8 force damage** upon you.",
           "8": "**Field Stabilizer:** Your control over the wild energy improves. While in Fury mode, you gain **temporary resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage**. Additionally, the Overload check becomes slightly more forgiving—now only a roll of 1–2 (instead of 1–3) results in a misfire. The extra charge cost remains in effect, a constant reminder of the peril in channeling such furious power.",
           "12": "**Fury Unleashed:** Once per long rest, you can harness the full, unbridled might of the Unstable Fury Core. As an action, expend an extra **3 cell charges** to execute Fury Unleashed—a cataclysmic single-target attack that deals **4d10 force damage**. The target must also make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier); on a failure, it is stunned until the end of your next turn.\n**Severe Overload Risk:** While using Fury Unleashed, immediately perform an overload check. If you roll a 1 on a d20, the chaotic energies erupt back against you, inflicting **4d10 force damage**.\nAfter using Fury Unleashed, you cannot activate Unstable Fury mode again until you complete a long rest, as your core requires deep recalibration from the massive energy discharge."

            "8": "When your Mephidium Coda is soiled, your next attack within the following round deals an extra 1d8 poison damage. Additionally, any target hit must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC increased by 1) or be poisoned for 1 round.",
            "12": "Unleash the ultimate \"Accidental Misfortune.\" Once per long rest, you may invoke this power as an action. All enemies—and any unfortunate allies within a 15‑ft radius—must immediately make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 16 or your class save DC, whichever is higher). On a failure, they are overwhelmed by a vile stench and become incapacitated with nausea (treated as the poisoned condition) for 1 round while taking 2d8 poison damage. Until the start of your next long rest, any activation of Toxic Emission further increases your bonus to poison-based effect rolls by +2, and your resistance to poison damage is doubled."
